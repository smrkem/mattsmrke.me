        review: "This course has 2 parts - an intro to rspec and a workout app. The first part of started well enough but ended up being disappointing. It introduces rspec and feature tests, but fails to include any other kinds of test (unit, controller, helper). When the author introduces ActionCable and real-time features - he skimps on explanations and ignores testing entirely.\nThe second part is an interesting app, but again - no unit tests and the real-time ActionCable stuff goes completely untested.",

        review: "This course provides a great introduction to serverless architecture. Mike (the instructor) is knowledgeable, friendly and engaging and does a good job with presenting the material. The project built throughout does a really good job of demonstrating serverless patterns and principles, and works great with a little bit of debugging using the code provided.\nThe course's major downside for me was that all of the code was simply provided and not really explained at all. So, for example, while the course demonstrates that you can generate a pre-singed url which can be used by a broser to upload a file directly to S3 - it does absolutely nothing to teach students specifically how to accomplish that task. It took time to go over all the code, googling when necessary, in order to really understand what was happening.",

It covers an S3 upload, a Kinesis Stream input and a DynamoDB put and provides a solid overview of Lambda. All the content is there, but unfortunately it's not presented very well and there are some minor video editing issues.",

        review: "A fast-paced walkthrough for an Angular app that communicates with 2 different Rails API services. This course doesn't teach anything about Rails - it's only used to scaffold the APIs for the Angular app. Not a bad introduction to Angular - but I found I had to constantly google for updated code as well as clearer explanations of the Angular concepts.",

        review: "A great introduction to AWS services and information about the AWS exams and certification process. The course gives a good overview of the relevant AWS services, and is followed up with hands-on labs and practice exams. While this course, on its own, is probably not enough to pass the exam - the discussion boards are great and point to more than enough supplementary learning resources to master the material."

        review: "This course was a very hands-on guide to deploying a dockerized app on a load-balanced cluster in AWS. I love that it used the command-line for all of the AWS stuff - that goes a long way towards keeping things relevant as the AWS services get updated. While explanations didn't go very deep - all the steps were there and it wasn't difficult to find a lot of supplementary information online."

        review: "This course was fantastic. After a brief refresher on some python tools (NumPy, SciPy, Matplotlib), it dives right into analyzing some real and very interesting case data. DNA Translation, Language Processing, Classification and Social Network Analysis - each case study introduces new topics like principal component analysis or k-nearest neighbor classification. The instructor is clear, knowledgeable and engaging and the case study material is easily digestable but compelling enough that I found myself doing a little extra reading outside the scope of the course."
